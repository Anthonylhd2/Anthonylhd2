# 👋 Hi, I'm Anthony Lahoud!

💻 **3rd Year Computer Science Student** at Notre Dame University Louaize, passionate about both **frontend** and **backend** development. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code and constantly seek opportunities to apply and refine my skills.

📚 I’m currently working on a **Warehouse Management System (WMS)** app using **Flutter** for mobile development, **Laravel** for the backend, and **PostgreSQL** as the database. This project has been a great way to deepen my understanding of software development while experimenting with new technologies.

🎓 I’ll be graduating next spring and plan to pursue a **Master’s in Software Engineering**. I’m always open to collaborating on meaningful projects and finding practical solutions to real-world challenges.
